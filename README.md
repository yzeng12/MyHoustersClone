# Application Features!

### 3.1 Tenant Tracking:
Manage tenants and their lease terms. Track how much rent is owed by
each tenant, when tenants are late on rent, and when lease agreements
are ending.

### 3.2 Accounting:
Manually add transactions for rent payments, bills, etc..., setup
recurring transactions, or import your transactions automatically.
Enable double-entry accounting mode and input all accounts affected in
a transaction. Reconcile accounts against statements.

### 3.3 Task Management:
Add to-do lists to track tasks you need to complete on your rentals,
such as finding a tenant for a unit that will soon be vacant or fixing
a leak in a roof. Assign tasks to vendors and invite them to login to
Apps and view/update the tasks assigned to them.

### 3.4 Financial Performance:
View key performance metrics for each of your properties, such as
gross income, operating costs, net operating income, cash gain, and
cash on cash invested.

### 3.5 Alerts:
Alerts will be generated when tenants are late on rent, lease
agreements are ending, task deadlines are approaching, and more. These
alerts can be delivered to your email or you can just view them on the
Apps dashboard.

### 3.6 Documents:
Upload rental documents to Apps server, such as lease agreements or 3
day notices, and then pull them up on your phone for quick and easy
reference.

### 3.7 Tenant Interaction:
Invite tenants to join Apps, which gives them the ability to view how much rent

the system in detail by categorizing them according to their
functionality. For each of the feature, we will give an introduction,
purpose, flow diagram and the sample output window. Introduction part
will give basic background information about the feature. After that,
we will show a diagram for the feature representing flow of events.
